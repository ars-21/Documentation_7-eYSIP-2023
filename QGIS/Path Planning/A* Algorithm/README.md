## A* (A-Star) Algorithm

The A* (A-Star) algorithm is a popular path planning algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path between a starting point and a goal point in a graph or grid-based environment. It combines the best features of Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy search by using heuristics to guide the search process.

### How it works

1. The A* algorithm maintains two lists: an open list and a closed list. The open list contains the nodes to be explored, while the closed list contains the nodes that have already been visited.

2. Initially, the open list only contains the starting node. The cost associated with each node is calculated based on the cumulative cost to reach that node from the start node and a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal node.

3. The algorithm selects the node with the lowest cost from the open list and expands it by examining its neighboring nodes. For each neighbor, it calculates the cost to reach that neighbor and updates its cost and parent if it provides a better path.

4. The algorithm continues this process, selecting the node with the lowest cost from the open list and expanding its neighbors, until it reaches the goal node or the open list becomes empty.

5. Once the goal node is reached, the algorithm reconstructs the path from the start node to the goal node by following the parent pointers recorded during the search.

### Implementation

The implementation of the A* algorithm can be found in the [a_star.py]() file. The file contains a function `a_star(start, goal, graph)` that takes the starting node, goal node, and a graph representation as input, and returns the shortest path between the start and goal nodes.

To use the A* algorithm, you need to provide a graph representation that defines the connectivity and costs between nodes in the environment. The specific format of the graph representation may vary based on your application.
